do npm run dev on the backend,

then do npm run dev on the frontend,

on the backend it is http://localhost:5555/

on the frontend it is http://localhost:5173/ (atleast during testing, either way terminal will tell you the link)

The mongoDB link to the database is in config.js, it should just be pulling from there.
